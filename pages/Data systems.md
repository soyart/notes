## Transactional vs Analytics #Databases
	- ### Transactions (OLTP)
		- Most database use is transactional
		- We only need to **read and write a small chunks of data in transactions**
		- But these **transactions occur very frequently**, and users will most likely be writing and reading from these databases
		- Optimized for low latency, for best user experience
		- Most of the times, the query is **row-based** (i.e. the application consumes a lot of columns)
	- ### Analytics (OTAP)
		- E.g. business analysts query all sales data of the last month, summing up revenue and costs, etc.
		- Usually #SQL
		- Usually involve very large reads
		- Because these analytics queries are expensive, we usually create new databases just for analytics, called [[Data warehouse]]
		- [[Data warehouse]]
			- Data warehouses contains specialized tables just for analytics
			- The created tables are called *fact tables*, or sometimes *view table*
			- Fact tables sync with main database once every fixed intervals
			- Fact tables usually have only columns for analytics, and usually extract some data from multiple OTLP databases and aggregate them (ETL - extract-transform-load)
				- For example, a fact table `fact_sales` may contain data from multiple *dimension* tables `dim_date`, `dim_customers`, `dim_stocks`, `dim_products`. (star schema)
				- Fact tables usually have very large number of columns - in the hundreds
				- OTAP dimension tables allow analysts to normalize fact tables and to join multiple fact tables, and
				- When dimension tables also get broken down, we call it *snowflake schema*
			- Fact table storage: [[column-oriented storage]]
				- Because fact tables usually have hundreds of columns, and millions of rows, we'll have bad performance if we simply query it all
				- Most of the times we only need a few columns for a particular *analytics*, and so most other columns are ignored
				- Even if we use indexes on interesting columns, the indexed data is still a full row
				- Instead, we store data in columns, instead of rows, to speed up specific queries.
				- **All column files have the same length, like keeping 2 arrays**
				- We can also group these column files together by any columns which would make our analytics runs fastest
				- Column values tend to be repetitive, so we can use compression to reduce I/O:
					- Bitmap coding
					- Bitmap coding + Run-length coding
