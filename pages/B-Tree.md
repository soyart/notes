- #[[Data Structure]]
- B-Tree is a **self-balancing tree**, and it's *not a binary tree*.
- ## In practice
	- Usually, the height is the number of disk operations we perform
	- Each node (page) in a B-Tree is typically mapped directly to disk block size
		- Is good for
		  collapsed:: true
			- DB indexes
			- Optimizing disk spaces
				- Given `t` degree and `n` nodes, the height is $\boxed{\log_t(n+1)/2}$
					- `t` is usually >2 and maybe in the hundreds or thousands
					- So we can think of it as $\boxed{\log(n)}$
- ## B-Tree nodes
	- Each node has 2 main components: keys and values
	- The keys are used for identifying targets
	- Values could be references to children, or actual values
- ## B-Tree node types
	- Root node
	- Internal nodes (always have children)
	- Leaf nodes
- ## B-Tree properties (Knuth definition)
	- Every node has at most `m` children.
	- Every internal node has at least `⌈m/2⌉` children.
	- The root node has at least two children unless it is a leaf.
	- All leaves appear on the same level.
	- A non-leaf node with `k` children contains `k-1` keys.
- ## B-Tree properties (with degree *t*)
	- `t` is the minimum degree of the whole tree `T`
		- if `t` is 2, then every nodes except the root can have at least 2 children
	- Number of keys of internal nodes (except root)
		- at least `t-1` keys
		- at most `2t-1` keys
	- Number of children of internal nodes
	  collapsed:: true
		- at least `t` children
		- at most `2t` children
- ## Search
	- Start from root
	- Assume nodes have 3 keys (therefore 4 child)
	- ```
	  [ ref1 | key1 | ref2 | key2 | ref3 | key3 | ref4]
	  ```
	- Compare target with keys in root, starting from its first key (key1)
		- If `target == key1` or any other key -> return value
		- If `target < key1` -> go search `ref1`
		- If `key1 < target < key2` -> go search `ref2`
		- If `key2 < target < key3` -> go search `ref3`
		- If `key3 < target` -> go search `ref4`
